To use the P(k) fitting code:

1) The covariance matrix. 
Currently the code only lets you use the mock covariance matrix. In order to
calculate this, you need to have the average P(k) from a set of mocks in the 
file "red_norec_avg.pk". You must also have a list of all the mock P(k) in 
the file "red_norec.txt".

2) You can change the cosmological parameters in the file. 

3) If you want to change the fitting range, you will need to manually adjust
it in the code. The variables sub1 and sub2 are the indices of the smallest
and largest k-values in the fitting range.
NOTE: sub2 is actually the index of the largest k-value PLUS ONE!

4) You can adjust the form of the A(k) marginalization term. Currently the
code has A(k) = k + ..., so the lowest order term is linear. In the code
there is a variable called btemp, which is currently

btemp = k**(1.*i) [for i starting at 1]

You can adjust the exponent on k accordingly by using i+N or i-N, etc, BUT,
i MUST start at 1.

5) You have the option of including basic RSD in the fitting model (uncomment
the pertinent lines in the code, search for RSD).

6) There are NO priors on anything in the fitting.

7) To run:
python inv_testmocks_full.py -n[] -s[]
For -n, the argument should be the number of terms you want in A(k)
For -s, the argument should be: z for sigma_nl=0
				f for fiducial sigma_nl (I think it's 8)
				p for fiducial sigma_nl+2
				m for fiducial sigma_nl-2
				i for sigma_nl=1000 (i.e. no BAO)

8) Output:
nalpha* - alpha, chi^2, b^2
nstd* - alpha, sigma_alpha (with log prior, width = 0.15), sigma_alpha (no prior), p(alpha < 1)
ninv* - plots of fits
